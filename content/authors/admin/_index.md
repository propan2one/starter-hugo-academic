I am a Biocomputer Scientist (*aka* bioinformatician) working in the pharmaceutical industry at Sanofi. I was previously a PhD fellow at Montepllier University where I received my PhD in Bioinformatics. My research focus is on genomics, transcriptomics and structural biology methods for improved characterization of vaccine-related samples. In my free time, I enjoy writing code to forward education. Once in a while, I try to make time for skatebording.
