	abstract = {Juvenile Paciﬁc oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are subjected to recurrent episodes of mass mortalities that constitute a threat for the oyster industry. This mortality syndrome named "Paciﬁc Oyster Mortality Syndrome" ({POMS}) is a polymicrobial disease whose pathogenesis is initiated by a primary infection by a variant of an Ostreid herpes virus named {OsHV}-1 µVar. The characterization of the {OsHV}-1 genome during different disease outbreaks occurring in different geographic areas has revealed the existence of a genomic diversity for {OsHV}-1 µVar. However, the biological signiﬁcance of this diversity is still poorly understood. To go further in understanding the consequences of {OsHV}-1 diversity on {POMS}, we challenged ﬁve biparental families of oysters to two different infectious environments on the French coasts (Atlantic and Mediterranean). We observed that the susceptibility to {POMS} can be different among families within the same environment but also for the same family between the two environments. Viral diversity analysis revealed that Atlantic and Mediterranean {POMS} are caused by two distinct viral populations. Moreover, we observed that different oyster families are infected by distinct viral populations within a same infectious environment. Altogether these results suggest that the co-evolutionary processes at play between {OsHV}-1 µVar and oyster populations have selected a viral diversity that could facilitate the infection process and the transmission in oyster populations. These new data must be taken into account in the development of novel selective breeding programs better adapted to the oyster culture environment.},
