	abstract = {The genetic diversity of viral populations is a key driver of the spatial and temporal diffusion of viruses; yet, studying the diversity of whole genomes from natural populations still remains a challenge. Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for {RNA} viruses harboring small genomes but have only rarely been applied to {DNA} viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 ({OsHV}-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and an innovative combination of bioinformatics tools, we de novo assembled twenty-one {OsHV}-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor genetic variations, phylogenetic analysis, and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches, we assessed the connectivity of {OsHV}-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes-Ol√©ron Bay represents the main source of {OsHV}-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. We demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to aquatic {DNA} viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns.},
